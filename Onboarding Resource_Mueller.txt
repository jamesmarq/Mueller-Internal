RECURRING MEETINGS / STAFF GATHERINGS

Every Monday morning at 8AM, the full Mueller team gathers for a weekly all-staff meeting. 

At the meeting, teams have the opportunity to report out to the full staff about client progress / timely items and / or ask for updates from their teams. We do not go client by client, but rather leave it to team leads’ discretion as to whether there is something that needs to be brought up on a given day. 

Staff meetings are a great place to:
Remind someone of an upcoming deadline / check in on project status
Share a major client milestone / next step
Celebrate team members’ successes  

In addition to client-related updates, we also make time to focus in on one client we are currently working with and one best practice. These items are assigned to staff members on a weekly basis. 

We wrap the meeting by discussing timely items to include in our social feeds and then we adjourn with our Monday morning Mueller-ism: Let’s Go Get ‘Em!

STAFF MEETING NOTES

WEEKLY BRAINSTORM
Each week, Mueller Communications convenes for a brainstorming session. This is an opportunity to share what we’re working on, and solicit feedback or creative ideas from our colleagues. If you have a topic you would like to brainstorm with staff, circulate a note outlining the topic the Monday before our Tuesday brainstorms. Unless otherwise directed by the client team lead, weekly brainstorm sessions should be billed to PD/T.  

BROWNBAGS
Mueller Communications strives to have regular opportunities for staff to engage in professional development. One informal way we do so is through staff-led brown bag sessions covering a variety of timely topics. If you have a suggested topic for a brown bag, let Elizabeth know. 

MEET THE MEDIA
Mueller Communications greatly values its relationship with members of the media. One way we build these relationships is by inviting members of the media in to meet our staff, have an informal conversation and have lunch.

29
“BOOK CLUB”
In an effort to educate ourselves about systemic racism in our community and in the country, Mueller staff gathers for bi-monthly “Book Club” gatherings to discuss anti-racism materials, stories detailing the BIPOC experience in America, and any other resources that can inform us of and help us to combat the inequity and injustice that persist in all aspects of society. This is a safe space for challenging conversations and insights and we encourage all staff who are interested to come with open minds and open hearts as we learn and grow together.

In general, prior to the gathering, Anna and/or Kirsten will send out a recent article, podcast, or topic to explore and we unpack it together, answering questions like:
What did you learn?
What surprised you?
What new concepts or ideas are you struggling with and why? 
What questions do you still have, or where would you like to dive deeper into the topic at hand?
How does this work connect to other works we’ve discussed, current events or lived experiences? 
How can we enact what we’ve learned in our everyday lives? In our work?

A few times a year, we actually read a book together and discuss! See our reading recs on Notion or in the book swap doc.
Additionally, we track resources on the staff Anti-Racism Resource page on Notion. Our book swap and reviews can be found in the Anti-Racism Resource Folder.

TIME TRACKING & INVOICES

35
At Mueller Communications we invoice our clients based on billable hours or “professional fees.” In short, that means that every hour of time you invest to help a client reach its goals gets billed back to the client on a monthly basis. For this reason, we track our time. Throughout the workday, you will be expected to track your time in six-minute increments. At the end of each day, you’ll enter that time into our time tracking software called BigTime and it will be tallied up at the end of the month to form the basis for an invoice that is posted to each client.

Each Monday morning, senior staff reviews time entered for each staff member. Gauging where employees are in terms of billable hours helps us assess who is busy and might need some help to rearrange their workload, as well as where staff might want or need to get plugged into new projects. It also helps us ensure we are ontrack against monthly budgets, because we can see in real time how many hours have been invested for a given client. 

The end of the month is when we prepare invoices, including summary pages. It is extremely important to understand that every single staff member’s time for the entire month has to be submitted before even one invoice can go out. That means that just one team member’s delay in time entry can hold up our entire invoicing process - significantly impacting our cash flow. 

We ask that you join us in committing to promptly and accurately entering your time and supporting our account support team as they execute our invoicing process.
A NOTE ON TIME ENTRY
Time entry is not everyone’s favorite thing - but it is one of the most important aspects of our work, because it is how we capture the value of the time you spend - and how we  bill our clients so we can all get paid. 
It is absolutely critical that each staff member’s time is entered on a regular basis. 

Big Time is Mueller’s time tracking platform. You will receive a training with the account support team, but here are a couple helpful resources tied to time tracking:

TIMESHEET TEMPLATE
BALLPARK TIME GUIDELINES

37
Mueller Communications posts invoices, which are payable upon receipt, at the end of each month for services performed that month. Each invoice includes a breakdown of professional fees, out-of-pocket expenses and a narrative summary of activities performed. We call this narrative a “summary page.” 

Each team is responsible for drafting this summary and should use BigTime reports to help determine the activities to be included.

Like time entry, invoices cannot go out until summary pages are complete. It is critical that each client team assigns a team member to complete the monthly summary page and that it is promptly completed at the end of the month.

MENTOR PROGRAM

As a firm, we greatly value mentor relationships and know the important role they play in personal and professional development. We also know there is no “one-size-fits-all” to mentoring - mentor relationships should be tailored to the unique needs of each team member.
Based on your input, we have updated our mentorship program to align with best practices and what we have heard from you in terms of benefits, cadence and needs.
We wholeheartedly believe that mentor programs are a valuable investment in the well-being and personal and professional development of the team. We also know that mentoring programs are only as valuable as the time you commit to it: we encourage you to prioritize this program moving forward.
As always, if you have questions, suggestions or feedback, please don’t hesitate to reach out. 
Sincerely,


JAMES & LORI

CIVIC POLICY

Mueller Communications encourages employees to become involved with organizations and efforts they are passionate about, and that better the communities in which they live and work.
As part of our support of that work, Mueller Communications has developed the following policy related to employees’ “civic engagement.”
Mueller Communications’ staff may log 12 billable hours per year to the civic engagement code each year to be counted as billable credit toward each employees’ billable standard. This time is to be used to volunteer with, provide pro-bono PR services for or serve on the board of a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

Additionally, at Mueller Communications, we recognize that persistent and systemic racism is a deep wound in our country and our community. We believe we can use our voices, our influence, and our power to empower those who have been oppressed for decades, in our beloved Milwaukee and beyond. We encourage our employees to be engaged and informed on issues of racial injustice. As a result, up to 12 additional billable civic hours can also be used specifically in time devoted to:
Educating yourself on issues of systemic racism, including reading / listening / watching resources designed to educate on the issue and / or directly participating in training programs, discussions / webinars and / or peaceful protests; and / or
Contributing pro-bono services to organizations that are making a difference in the area of racial equity.
CONT.

In order to receive billable credit for time devoted to these items, staff members must report out on their experience, sharing insights and lessons learned with staff. Summary reports should be shared with Lori Richards and James Madlom within one week of billing your time and should include:
Time invested
Summary of how time was spent (including links to resources reviewed, if relevant)
2-3 key takeaways / lessons learned to share with your colleagues.

If volunteer time takes place during the workday, ensure client needs have been met, inform your manager and include on your calendar. Please note, employees may also do additional pro bono work in the Civic code that does not count toward billable goal but are expected to continue to meet all client and internal deadlines.
Mueller Communications encourages employees to become involved with organizations and efforts they are passionate about, and that better the communities in which they live and work.
As part of our support of that work, Mueller Communications has developed the following policy related to employees’ “civic engagement.”

SHARED DRIVES

Shared drives are spaces where teams can store their files and guarantee that every member has the most up-to-date information, no matter the time or place.  

WHAT MAKES SHARED DRIVES SPECIAL?
Every person and Google Group added to a shared drive gets instant access to the shared drives' documents. Shared drives are designed to store the team’s work collectively, so if a document’s creator moves off of the team that document doesn’t go with them. As a matter of practice, the “allstaff-access” group should be added to all Client Shared Drives as Content Manager so that the firm can benefit from the full resources of all client teams. 

HOW DO I GET STARTED?
Go to drive.google.com. You will see a “shared drives” option in the left column. Click on it to view the drives currently available to you. Click “new” to create a new shared drive for a client. Then choose “Manage Members” and add allstaff-access@muellercommunications.com as a Content Manager. This ensures that all employees of the firm have access to client files.  In addition, add the graphic design team designers@muellercommunications.com as Manager to ensure the design team can manage the design folder. Bonus: add Kirsten as a Manager and she can help you adjust settings or move folders.

CAN I ACCESS IT FROM THE MAC FINDER?
Yes! First, install Google Drive for Desktop. This will create an app shortcut on your menu bar, top right. Click the icon (or go to launcher) and sign in to your account. Google Drive will now show in your folders in Finder.  
Note: If you can’t see google drive, go to Finder -> Preferences and turn on Locations: External disks
Note: Technically this allows Finder/Spotlight to search Google Drive.  In practice this currently freezes Finder as Spotlight search tries to index every single file. To avoid this, block spotlight from indexing Drive by following these instructions.  This will still allow you to access files. Search remains fully enabled in the browser. 
Open System Preferences -> Spotlight
Select the Privacy tab
Click on the plus ‘+’ sign
Select the Google Drive File Stream folder
Note: Pro-Tip: Consider installing Command E which will fully search Google Drive from a popup window on your mac. It also learns your preferred files and provides smarter results the more you use it.

CAN I USE FILES OFFLINE?
Yes! If you’ve installed the Desktop app, any file that has a local app (e.g., PDF, Excel Docs, Word Docs) is accessible without any additional steps. To access Google files (Doc, Sheets) offline, you need to use Chrome and have offline editing enabled.  You can enable and install the Chrome extension here. Use Google Drive files offline - Computer - Google Drive Help

WHAT SHOULD I NAME MY FILES?Thanks to Google’s search capabilities, it’s more important to name a file wisely than to create a hierarchy of folders.  Name your file with the information you’d search for - client name, type, date, version.  You can see our format suggestions here.

MEDIA MONITORING

All staff are expected to read the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel each day and the Milwaukee Business Journal each week. (Logins to e-editions are available in 1Password. 

Additionally, staff are assigned publications and shows to monitor for client mentions and articles of interest, as outlined here. 

This means reviewing the publication when it arrives / is published or a show airs to determine if there are any articles involving our clients. As always, the goal is to deliver the clip to the client before they see it themselves. 

If there are any such articles, it is your responsibility to alert client team members and to ensure the client gets a copy ASAP. Please look for news about our clients, issues that are of interest to our clients, or other information that would be helpful to Mueller Communications. 

Each staff member is allotted 1.5 hours per month for media research. This is billable time. Each staff person should NOT exceed 1.5 hours per month, as these costs are passed on to clients. 
In addition to monitoring tools like Critical Mention and Google Alerts, we want to actively monitor local publications for trends, articles of interest, etc. that may not fall within our alert parameters.
Be sure to bookmark the Publication Resource Guide. It holds a slew of valuable information -- primarily contact information for members of the media in different markets and editorial calendars. The junior staff works together to update this on a rolling basis and they will help walk you through this.

WIFI: Mueller Wifi	      PASSWORD: !SpeakS0ftly  (that's a zero) 

You can also use the 'guest' wifi and share with your visitors - this one doesn't include access to the printers or TVs but otherwise functions normally; just open a browser to log in.

WIFI: Mueller Guest      PASSWORD: free-wifi

Connecting to the printer:  The upstairs printer (MX3070) is set up in the kitchen and is accessible only if you are connected to the Mueller Wifi.  If you need to install drivers, they are available on the shared drive here, with a guide here.

Printing is also available via AirPrint. Connect to the Mueller Wifi and follow these instructions.  AirPrint is useful for printing from your phone but can cause issues with designed pdfs.

Although we primarily use Google for all services, we've found that some staff still need Microsoft programs for a few client projects.  You have the basic suite installed on your computer, and Kirsten will provide you with your login credentials.

Please note we don't use OneDrive, microsoft's online file storage, and as we sometimes move licenses around we make it a best practice not to save files there.  When saving, hit the bottom lefthand button titled "On My Mac" to switch to your regular spot (documents, downloads, desktop).  The program will always default to your last save location, but occasionally when you install updates it will go back to the Cloud location - so keep an eye on it.

ANSWERING SERVICE
Mueller Communications has a call service that answers calls when the office is closed. This is a key service we provide to our clients and to the media. If you receive a call after hours and it is urgent (a client having a crisis and / or a media call), you will be texted with the relevant information. Ginny will work with you to get your cell phone on the service’s distribution list.

The protocol / steps that will be taken to dispatch media/urgent calls are:
STEP ONE:
Call service texts message to person asked for. Service waits 10 minutes. If unconfirmed, they take Step Two
STEP TWO:
Call service group texts all senior staff.
STEP THREE:
Call service calls the person asked for. If no answer, service will leave a message and begin calling other members of staff until the message is confirmed as delivered.
To accept responsibility for a text message, all you need to do is reply with the word "OK" and your name. Someone must accept responsibility for the message or the call service will continue to try to reach someone.

ASANA
Asana is Mueller Communications’ task management platform. While we have found the best “training” is to spend some time familiarizing yourself with the platform and using it in your team meetings, here are some key resources to consider for onboarding:

Google Alerts
This is a great secondary tool for monitoring media hits! Someone on one of your client team’s will walk you through setting up one/multiple Google alerts. 

Mueller Communications utilizes 1Password for site access and password storage.  

Your team login will have access to the same vaults of Mueller vendors and logins.  There is no limit to how many devices can be logged in at one time.  You will need to enter the security key the first time you log in on a new device.

We will be activating two-factor on all sites possible.  To use two-factor authentication, simply make sure you’re actively logged in to 1Password, and use its autofill on the website - it will generate and fill a one-time password for two-factor authentication, bypassing the need for a texted access code.

The emergency kit as linked below will remain on Drive so that you can access it for security key and password as needed.  As a best practice, add a shortcut link to this document to your personal Google Drive.
